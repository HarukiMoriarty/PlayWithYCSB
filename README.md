Yo hiiiiiiiiiii 👋

This is a personal repo where I mess around with YCSB benchmarks on all kinds of distributed systems—Cloud OLTP/OLAP DBs, NoSQL DBs, you name it.  

The whole thing started as part of my final project for CS 739 at UW–Madison. After building an entire distributed key-value store from scratch, I was totally wiped out and just wanted to run some chill benchmarks for a change.

While digging into YCSB, I realized it's actually super fun and got me thinking more about how different system architectures affect performance. That said, the official YCSB docs kinda fall short when it comes to walking you through how to hook it up with specific distributed systems or get the environments set up. Totally fair though—those parts are usually covered in the system’s own docs.

Anyway, I figured I can’t be the only one who’s both curious and a bit lazy (or maybe just tired like me 😮‍💨), so I put together this repo to make life easier. Hopefully, it helps others get YCSB up and running with less headache.  
(Of course, you’ll need some kind of cluster to actually run stuff—I can’t give you that, sorry 😅)

Have fun and go break some distributed systems!
